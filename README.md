# YELP-FOOD-APP
In the making of this app i learned how to fetch data from API. I had to use a VPN to access data because YELP is not in INDIA yet! I ran my first JSON server using ngrok,learnt about async storage, useEffect & useState hooks, component destructuring,  got a broader idea about state management, react navigation. Although this was a beginner project but i've gotten my basics clear while making this project. And the feeling of seeing the green screen while running json server for the first time made me feel like a hacker they show in the movies, LOL! If you're getting started with React Native, i highly recommend this project! GOOD LUCK CODING!
